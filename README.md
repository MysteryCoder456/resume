# Resume

I use [Resumake](https://resumake.io/) to create and generate résumés.
In this repository, you will find a `resume.json` file which is what Resumake
uses to generate a PDF version of my résumé. You will also find every iteration
of my résumé in PDF form, marked with the date it was generated on. The latest
one should be at the bottom of the file list, since GitHub sorts files in
alphabetical order.
